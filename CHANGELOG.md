## [Unreleased]
<!-- Please update cartridge-cli/VERSION.lua with new release -->

### Changed

- Prettified `start` and `stop` logs
- `start` and `stop` commands try to start/stop all instances and accumulate

  This option allows to build application in docker image.

## [1.5.0] - 2020-03-27

### Changed

### Added

units) to be platform independent.

## [1.4.1] - 2020-03-06

### Changed

- Improved arguments parsing:
  * boolean flags `--flag` shouldn't be passed after all other options;
  * Both `--long_opt` and `--long-opt` patterns can be used, it will be parsed
    as `long_opt` option

### Fixed
