"The ``cartridge replicasets`` command is used to set up replica sets on "
"local start."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid "All ``replicasets`` sub-commands have these flags:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``--name`` - application name"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``--run-dir`` - directory where PID and socket files are stored (defaults to"
" ./tmp/run or \"run-dir\" in .cartridge.yml)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``--cfg`` - configuration file for instances (defaults to ./instances.yml or"
" \"cfg\" in .cartridge.yml)"
msgstr ""

msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Replicasets are configured via instance console sockets placed in the run "
"directory using Cartridge Lua API. All topology instances should be "
"described in the ``instances.yml`` file (see ``--cfg``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, all running instances mentioned in ``instances.yml`` are connected to"
" membership. It's required to check if there are any instances that are "
"already joined to cluster. One of these instances is used to perform "
"operations with cluster."

msgid "Setup replica sets described in a file"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flags:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``--file`` - file where replica sets configuration is described (defaults to"
" replicasets.yml)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``--bootstrap-vshard`` - flag indicates that vshard should be bootstrapped"

msgid "Example configuration:"

msgid ""
"All instances should be described in ``instances.yml`` (or other file passed"

msgid "Save current replica sets to a file"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``--file`` - file where replica sets configuration should be saved (defaults"

msgid ""
"If a replica set with the specified alias isn't found in cluster, it is "
"created. Otherwise, instances are joined to the existing replica set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To join an instance to the replica set, we need to know instance's advertise"
" URI . Advertise URIs should be described in ``instances.yml``."

msgid "List available roles"

msgid "List available vshard groups"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add roles to replicaset"
