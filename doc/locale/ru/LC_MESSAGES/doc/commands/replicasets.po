"The ``cartridge replicasets`` command is used to configure replica sets on "

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

msgid "The following flags work with any ``replicasets`` subcommand:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``--name``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Application name."
msgstr ""

msgid "``--run-dir``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The directory where PID and socket files are stored. Defaults to "
"``./tmp/run`` or the ``run-dir`` value in ``.cartridge.yml``."
msgstr ""

msgid "``--cfg``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances' configuration file. Defaults to ``./instances.yml`` or the "
"``cfg`` value in ``.cartridge.yml``."
msgstr ""

msgid "How it works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Replicasets are configured using the Cartridge Lua API. All instances in the"
" topology are described in a single file, ``instances.yml`` (see the "
"``--cfg`` flag). The instances receive their configuration through instance "
"console sockets that can be found in the run directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, all the running instances mentioned in ``instances.yml`` are "
"organized into a :doc:`membership </reference/reference_rock/membership/>` "
"network. In this way, Cartridge checks if there are any instances that have "
"already joined the cluster. One of these instances is then used to perform "
"cluster operations."
