msgid ""
"Do not use ``repair`` if you aren't sure that it's exactly what you need."
msgstr ""

msgid "Always run ``repair`` with the ``--dry-run`` flag first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not hesitate to use the ``--verbose`` option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not use the ``--force`` option if you aren't sure that it's exactly what "
"you need."

msgid ""
"Please look at the :doc:`troubleshooting documentation "
"</book/cartridge/troubleshooting>` before using ``repair``."

msgid "list-topology"
msgstr ""

msgid "Prints the current topology summary. Requires no arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid "remove-instance"

msgid ""
"Removes an instance with the specified UUID from the cluster. If the "
"instance isn't found, raises an error."
msgstr ""

msgid "set-leader"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sets an instance as the leader of the replica set. Raises an error in the "
"following cases:"

msgid "set-uri"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid "Flags"

msgid "The following flags work with any ``repair`` subcommand:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``--name``"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Required) Application name."
msgstr ""

msgid "``--data-dir``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The directory containing the instances' working directories. Defaults to "
"``/var/lib/tarantool``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following flags work with any repair command except ``list-topology``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``--run-dir``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The directory where PID and socket files are stored. Defaults to "
"``/var/run/tarantool``."

msgid "``--reload``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable instance configuration reload after the patch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default data and run directories for ``repair`` differ from those used "
"by other ``cartridge-cli`` commands. This is because ``repair`` is intended "
"for production use, while other commands are for local development."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``repair`` also supports :doc:`global flags "
"</book/cartridge/cartridge_cli/global-flags>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "What does ``repair`` actually do?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It patches cluster-wide instance configuration files that you have on your "
"local machine. Note that it's not enough to *apply* the new configuration, "
"the instance has to *reload* it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although ``repair`` was created for production use, it can still be applied "
"in local development. The command requires to specify ``--name``, the "
"application name. Also, remember that the default data directory is "
"``/var/lib/tarantool`` and the default run directory is "
"``/var/run/tarantool``. To specify other directories, use the ``data-dir`` "
"and ``--run-dir`` options correspondingly or provide the paths in the "
":doc:`configuration file </book/cartridge/cartridge_cli/instance-paths>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In default mode, ``repair`` walks through all cluster-wide configurations in"
" the ``<data-dir>/<app-name>.*`` directories, patching all the configuration"
" files it locates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the ``--dry-run`` flag specified, files won't be patched, and you will "
"only see the computed configuration diff."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If different instances on the local machine use different configuration "
"files, ``repair`` raises an error. To patch different configuration versions"
" independently, use the ``--force`` option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If your application uses ``cartridge >= 2.0.0``, you can also run ``repair``"
" with the ``--reload`` flag to reload configuration for all your instances "
"through the console sockets in the run directory. Make sure that you have "
"the correct run directory specified when you use ``--reload``."
